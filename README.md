## IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2022

### Lab 1 - Introduction to Primitives on Qiskit Runtime

- Do you know that there is a way to maximize the quantum workflow in Qiskit? To execute quantum circuits, all of them are going through the cloud environment.
- Especially, there is an obvious delay when you are using an algorithm which requires feedback loops between classical and quantum hardware. In this kind of situation, we can expect a substantial speed-up on primitives with Qiskit Runtime.
- In exercise 1 we are going to learn what Qiskit Runtime and primitives are and how to use them in a proper way. We also comprehend the exact meaning of error mitigation and simple prologues of its techniques.
- As this exercise is including the primitives and the error mitigation techniques, it will be a basement for solving all the following exercises. Please free to explore as much as possible along with your own spaceship!
